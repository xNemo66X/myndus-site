  <h1>Decentralized Finance Guide 2025</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Module 1 – Introduction to DeFi</h2>
    <p>DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, refers to a new financial ecosystem built on public blockchains like Ethereum. It includes financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and earning interest without relying on traditional banks.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Module 2 – Evolution of Blockchain</h2>
    <p>Blockchain began with Bitcoin as a decentralized digital currency. The launch of Ethereum introduced smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) and platforms for complex financial operations without intermediaries.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Module 3 – Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Decentralization means no central authority controls the system. DeFi protocols use smart contracts to automate and secure financial interactions. Users retain full control of their assets, ensuring transparency and censorship resistance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Module 4 – Benefits and Risks</h2>
    <p>Benefits include accessibility, innovation, and yield opportunities. Risks involve volatility, smart contract bugs, and scams. Risk management and due diligence are essential before investing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Module 5 – Major Platforms</h2>
    <p>Popular DeFi platforms include Aave, Uniswap, Compound, Curve, and MakerDAO. These offer services such as automated market making, liquidity pools, lending protocols, and stablecoin issuance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Module 6 – Security Best Practices</h2>
    <p>Always use hardware wallets, enable two-factor authentication, avoid phishing links, and test new platforms with small amounts first. Diversification and ongoing education are crucial for safety in DeFi.</p>
